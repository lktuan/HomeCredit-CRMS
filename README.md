# HomeCredit - Credit Risk Model Stability

## Motivation

Found the **HomeCredit - Credit Risk Model Stability** competition through a [post](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7202186950538129408/) on Linked In by and [Tri Duc Nguyen Tang](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tri-duc-n-099528133/), although it's was late for submission but let's see how can I build a model from this data.
